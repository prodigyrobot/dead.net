social network for antisocial, criminal, frightened, security aware and otherwise sick people

This is a cool social network platform with following targets:


-full anonymity and identity change are possible


-no possibility for gov or cops to trace user identity or prove user connection to information


-user does not matter, even YOU!, only information matters


-no human moderator allowed (they are all bastards, as we know)


-info stored only while it matters, dead info deleted immediatelly


-one click account deletion with no way to restore or trace identity is possible



Based on spring, cassandra and akka
